# Biomedical-signal-processing-project
This is a group project realized for the biomedical signal processing course in UPC. In the lab we recorded some medical signals (blood pressure, ECG). Then, some interesting parameters like the heart rate, the cardiac pulse and the sistolic and diastolic pressure were obtained.
Moreover, we analized the Korotkoff sounds, the blood volume and did a frequential analysis.
An analysis of the registered signals was achieved. We detected the noise and the interferences in the signals by using the DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) and then some filtering and signal conditioning was carried out.

Theoretical background and an explanation of the project is properly devoted in the pdf paper. The commented Matlab code is also attached in the Annex and a folder with the Matlab code can also be downloaded.
